Congratulations! You almost finished this chapter about loops in bash. There is one more thing left before we head on to the next chapter.

Most of the time your loops are going through in a smooth and orderly manner. Sometimes however you may need to intervene and alter their running slightly. There are two statements you may issue to do this: break and continue.

## "Break" out of an inner loop 

```yaml
type: FullSlide
key: eab7a94867
disable_transition: false
hide_title: false
```

`@part1`
The break statement is used to exit the current loop before its normal ending. 

In nested loops, break allows for specification of which loop to exit. See the Bash info pages for more.

```{r}
for (( i = 1; i < 5; i++ ))
do
  echo "Outer loop: $i"
  for (( j = 1; j < 10; j++ ))
  do
    if (( $j == 3 ))
    then
      break
    fi
    echo "Inner loop: $j"
  done
done
echo "this is the end of the script"
```

```{r }
$ ./bn-break-inner.sh
Outer loop: 1
Inner loop: 1
Inner loop: 2
Outer loop: 2
Inner loop: 1
Inner loop: 2
Outer loop: 3
Inner loop: 1
Inner loop: 2
Outer loop: 4
Inner loop: 1
Inner loop: 2
···{{}}


`@script`
The break statement tells Bash to leave the current loop straight away. Mind that break exits the loop, not the script. This can be demonstrated by adding an echo command at the end of the script.

## "Break" out of an inner loop

```yaml
type: TwoColumns
key: 578e8683d9
```

`@part1`
The break statement is used to exit the current loop before its normal ending. 
```
for ((i=1;i<5;i++)); do
  echo "Outer loop: $i"
  for ((j=1;j<10;j++)); do
    if (($j==3)); then
      break
    fi
    echo "Inner loop: $j"
  done
done
```{{1}}

`@part2`
```
Outer loop: 1
Inner loop: 1
Inner loop: 2
Outer loop: 2
Inner loop: 1
Inner loop: 2
Outer loop: 3
Inner loop: 1
Inner loop: 2
Outer loop: 4
Inner loop: 1
Inner loop: 2
```{{2}}

`@script`
The break statement tells Bash to leave the current loop straight away. Mind that break exits the loop, not the script. This can be demonstrated by adding an echo command at the end of the script.

## "Continue" Statement

```yaml
type: FullSlide
key: 0f7cf703a1
```

`@part1`
The continue statement tells Bash to stop running through this iteration of the loop and begin the next iteration. Sometimes there are circumstances that stop us from going any further. For instance, maybe we are using the loop to process a series of files but if we happen upon a file which we don't have the read permission for we should not try to process it.

## Example

```yaml
type: FullSlide
key: 7394ab522a
```

`@part1`
```
for i in 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10; do
  if (( $i < 5 )); then
    continue
  elif (( $i > 10 )); then
    break
  fi
  echo "number $i"
done
```

`@script`

## Difference between "break" and "continue"

```yaml
type: TwoColumns
key: 05eb52a1b8
```

`@part1`
This is part 1

**world** is a _beautiful_ 

- item
- item

[RStudio](https://www.rstudio.com/)

Let's try this

1. item1
2. item2
3. item3

`@part2`
This is part 2
