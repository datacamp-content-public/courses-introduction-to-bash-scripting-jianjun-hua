Congratulations! You almost finished this chapter about loops in bash. There is one more thing left before we head on to the next chapter.

Most of the time your loops are going through in a smooth and orderly manner. Sometimes however you may need to intervene and alter their running slightly. There are two statements you may issue to do this: break and continue.

## "Break" out of an inner loop

```yaml
type: FullSlide
key: eab7a94867
disable_transition: false
hide_title: false
```

`@part1`
The break statement is used to exit the current loop before its normal ending. 

In nested loops, break allows for specification of which loop to exit. See the Bash info pages for more.

```{r}
for (( i = 1; i < 5; i++ ))
do
  echo "Outer loop: $i"
  for (( j = 1; j < 10; j++ ))
  do
    if (( $j == 3 ))
    then
      break
    fi
    echo "Inner loop: $j"
  done
done

echo "The loop has terminated "
echo "but the script continues!"
```

```{r }
$ ./bn-break-inner.sh
Outer loop: 1
Inner loop: 1
Inner loop: 2
Outer loop: 2
Inner loop: 1
Inner loop: 2
Outer loop: 3
Inner loop: 1
Inner loop: 2
Outer loop: 4
Inner loop: 1
Inner loop: 2
···{{}}

`@script`
The break statement tells Bash to leave the current loop straight away. Mind that break exits the loop, not the script. This can be demonstrated by adding an echo command at the end of the script.

## "Break" out of an inner loop

```yaml
type: TwoColumns
key: 578e8683d9
```

`@part1`
The break statement is used to exit the current loop before its normal ending. 
```
for ((i=1;i<5;i++)); do
  echo "Outer loop: $i"
  for ((j=1;j<10;j++)); do
    if (($j==3)); then
      break
    fi
    echo "Inner loop: $j"
  done
done
```{{1}}

`@part2`
```
Outer loop: 1
Inner loop: 1
Inner loop: 2
Outer loop: 2
Inner loop: 1
Inner loop: 2
Outer loop: 3
Inner loop: 1
Inner loop: 2
Outer loop: 4
Inner loop: 1
Inner loop: 2
```{{2}}

`@script`
The break statement tells Bash to leave the current loop straight away. Please note here that break exits the loop, not the script. This can be demonstrated by adding an echo command at the end of the script.

Please have a look at the example here. The outer loop index i goes through one to four, while the inner loop index j is supposed to go through one to nine. However, since we set up a condition that whenever the inner loop index j is equal to 3, the inner loop is terminated by the break statement and move on to the next outer loop iteration. 

Using echo we can see the whole procedure. The outer loop goes from one to four but all the inner loops only go from one to ten because of the condition and the break statement.

## "Break" out of an outer loop

```yaml
type: TwoRows
key: 9f69bb5658
```

`@part1`
```
for ((i=1;i<5;i++)); do
  echo "Outer loop: $i"
  for ((j=1;j<10;j++)); do
    if (($j==3)); then
      break 2
    fi
    echo "Inner loop: $j"
  done; 
done
```{{1}}

`@part2`
The output is ...{{2}}
```
Outer loop: 1
Inner loop: 1
Inner loop: 2
```{{2}}

## "Continue" Statement

```yaml
type: FullSlide
key: 0f7cf703a1
```

`@part1`
```
for (( i = 1; i <= 10; i++)); do
  if (( $i >= 2)) && (( $i <= 8)); then
    continue
  fi
echo "Iteration number: $i"
done
```{{1}}
The output is ... {{2}}
```
Iteration number: 1
Iteration number: 9
Iteration number: 10
```{{2}}

`@script`
The continue statement tells Bash to stop running through this iteration of the loop and begin the next iteration. Sometimes there are circumstances that stop us from going any further. For instance, maybe we are using the loop to process a series of files but if we happen upon a file which we don't have the read permission for we should not try to process it.

## Example

```yaml
type: FullSlide
key: 7394ab522a
```

`@part1`
```
for i in $(seq 20); do
  if (( $i < 5 )); then
    continue
  elif (( $i > 15 )); then
    break
  fi
  echo "number $i"
done
```{{1}}
The output is ...{{2}}
```
number 5
number 6
number 7
number 8
number 9
number 10
number 11
number 12
number 13
number 14
number 15
```{{2}}

`@script`
