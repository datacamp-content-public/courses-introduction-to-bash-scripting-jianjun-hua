Congratulations! You almost finished this chapter about looping in bash. Now, there is one more thing left before we head on to the next chapter.

Most of the time your loops are going to through in a smooth and orderly manner. Sometimes however we may need to intervene and alter their running slightly. There are two statements we may issue to do this: break and continue. 

---

## "break"

```yaml
type: FullSlide
key: eab7a94867
disable_transition: false
hide_title: false
```

`@part1`
The break statement is used to exit the current loop before its normal ending. This is done when you do not know in advance how many times the loop will have to execute, for instance because it is dependent on user input.

Mind that break exits the loop, not the script. This can be demonstrated by adding an echo command at the end of the script. This echo will also be executed upon input that causes break to be executed (when the user types "0").

In nested loops, break allows for specification of which loop to exit. See the Bash info pages for more.



`@script`
The break statement tells Bash to leave the loop straight away. It may be that there is a normal situation that should cause the loop to end but there are also exceptional situations in which it should end as well. For instance, maybe we are copying files but if the free disk space get's below a certain level we should stop copying.

## "continue"

```yaml
type: FullSlide
key: 0f7cf703a1
```

`@part1`
The continue statement tells Bash to stop running through this iteration of the loop and begin the next iteration. Sometimes there are circumstances that stop us from going any further. For instance, maybe we are using the loop to process a series of files but if we happen upon a file which we don't have the read permission for we should not try to process it.

## Example

```yaml
type: FullSlide
key: 7394ab522a
```

`@part1`
```{r}
#!/bin/bash

for i in 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10

do

  if (( $i < 5 ));
  then
      continue
  elif (( $i > 10 ))
  then
      break
  fi

  echo "number $i"

done
```
