Congratulations! You almost finished this chapter about looping in bash. Now, there is one more thing left before we head on to the next chapter.

Most of the time your loops are going to through in a smooth and orderly manner. Sometimes however we may need to intervene and alter their running slightly. There are two statements we may issue to do this: break and continue.

## "Break" Statement

```yaml
type: FullSlide
key: eab7a94867
disable_transition: false
hide_title: false
```

`@part1`

```{r}
print("hello")
```
- item1
- item2
- item3
